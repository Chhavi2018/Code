Introduction to Agile: Agile is a methodology primarily used for software development that promotes iterative development, collaboration, and flexibility. The main goal of Agile is to deliver small, incremental changes to the product, ensuring continuous improvement and customer satisfaction.2. Principles of Agile: The principles of Agile are outlined in the Agile Manifesto. These principles emphasize:Customer satisfaction through early and continuous delivery of valuable software.Welcoming changing requirements, even late in development.Delivering working software frequently, from a couple of weeks to a couple of months, with a preference for the shorter timescale.Close, daily cooperation between business people and developers.Projects built around motivated individuals, who should be trusted.Face-to-face conversation as the best form of communication.Working software as the primary measure of progress.Sustainable development, able to maintain a constant pace.Continuous attention to technical excellence and good design.Simplicity—the art of maximizing the amount of work not done—is essential.Self-organizing teams.Regular reflection on how to become more effective, then tuning and adjusting behavior accordingly.3. Agile Manifesto: The Agile Manifesto consists of four core values:Individuals and interactions over processes and tools.Working software over comprehensive documentation.Customer collaboration over contract negotiation.Responding to change over following a plan.4. Scrum Master: The Scrum Master is responsible for ensuring the team follows Agile practices and principles. They facilitate communication, remove obstacles, and ensure the team is productive. The Scrum Master acts as a coach for the team, helping them understand and implement Scrum.5. Product Owner: The Product Owner is responsible for maximizing the value of the product resulting from the work of the Scrum Team. They manage the product backlog, ensuring it is clear, detailed, and prioritized. The Product Owner represents the stakeholders and acts as a bridge between the team and the customers.6. Principles of Scrum: Scrum is an Agile framework that is based on the following principles:Empirical Process Control: Knowledge comes from experience and making decisions based on what is known.Self-organization: Teams organize and manage their own work.Collaboration: Teams work together to achieve a common goal.Value-based prioritization: Delivering the most valuable items first.Time-boxing: Work is confined to regular, fixed-length intervals.Iterative development: Continuous feedback and improvement.7. Pillars of Scrum: Scrum is built on three pillars:Transparency: All aspects of the process must be visible to those responsible for the outcome.Inspection: Regular checks on the progress toward a goal to detect any undesirable variances.Adaptation: Adjusting processes and work in progress to minimize further issues.8. Values of Scrum: The five Scrum values are:Commitment: Team members personally commit to achieving the goals of the Scrum Team.Courage: Team members have the courage to do the right thing and work on tough problems.Focus: Everyone focuses on the work of the Sprint and the goals of the Scrum Team.Openness: The Scrum Team and its stakeholders agree to be open about all the work and the challenges with performing the work.Respect: Scrum Team members respect each other to be capable, independent people.9. Sprints: A Sprint is a time-boxed period (usually 1-4 weeks) during which the Scrum Team works to complete a set amount of work. Each Sprint begins with a Sprint Planning meeting where the team selects and commits to work items from the product backlog. The goal of each Sprint is to deliver a potentially shippable product increment.10. Daily Standup: The Daily Standup (or Daily Scrum) is a 15-minute time-boxed event held every day for the team to synchronize activities and create a plan for the next 24 hours. Team members answer three questions:What did I do yesterday that helped the team meet the Sprint Goal?What will I do today to help the team meet the Sprint Goal?Do I see any impediments that prevent me or the team from meeting the Sprint Goal?11. The Scrum Process: The Scrum process includes several key activities:Sprint Planning: The team collaborates to decide what work will be performed during the Sprint.Daily Standups: Daily meetings to discuss progress and obstacles.Sprint Review: A meeting held at the end of the Sprint to inspect the increment and adapt the product backlog if needed.Sprint Retrospective: A meeting to reflect on the past Sprint and plan improvements for the next Sprint.Backlog Refinement: The ongoing process of reviewing and prioritizing the product backlog.12. Conclusion: Agile, with Scrum as its most popular framework, offers a structured yet flexible approach to project management and software development. Through its principles, values, and structured processes, Agile ensures that teams can deliver high-quality products efficiently while continuously improving and adapting to changing needs.This document covers all the key points learned during the Agile session. Feel free to adjust or add any additional details specific to your team's practices or examples to make it more personalized.
Roles in Scrum1. Scrum Master:Role: Facilitator and coach.Responsibilities: Ensures the team adheres to Scrum practices, removes impediments, and fosters an environment for high performance. Guides the team through Scrum processes and helps resolve issues.2. Product Owner:Role: Stakeholder liaison and backlog manager.Responsibilities: Manages the product backlog, prioritizes tasks based on business value, and ensures the team is working on the most valuable tasks. Acts as a bridge between the team and stakeholders, ensuring clear communication of goals and requirements.3. Development Team:Role: Creators of the product increment.Responsibilities: Self-organizing and cross-functional group responsible for delivering potentially shippable product increments at the end of each Sprint. The team collaborates to complete tasks, ensures quality, and continuously improves processes.These roles collectively ensure that Scrum processes are followed, work is prioritized correctly, and the

team remains productive and motivated.

User StoriesUser Stories are short, simple descriptions of a feature or functionality written from the perspective of the end-user. They help to capture what the user needs and why. Each user story typically follows a simple template:As a [type of user], I want [an action] so that [a benefit/a value].Example:As a customer, I want to be able to track my order status so that I can know when it will be delivered.INVEST ModelThe INVEST model is a guideline to ensure that user stories are well-crafted and effective. The acronym INVEST stands for:Independent: The story should be self-contained, allowing it to be developed and delivered separately from other stories.Negotiable: The details of the story can be changed and negotiated. It's not a contract but a placeholder for conversation.Valuable: The story must deliver value to the end-user or customer.Estimable: The story should be small enough to estimate the effort required to implement it.Small: The story should be small enough to be completed within a single iteration or sprint.Testable: There should be clear criteria to determine when the story is complete and meets the requirements.By following the INVEST model, teams can ensure that their user stories are well-defined, actionable, and deliver meaningful value to the users.
